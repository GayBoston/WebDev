This is technically a box with information. It also takes up about 30% of the width of the screen. And heres an exerpt from the Bee Movie script: According to all known laws
of aviation,
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow.
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Ooming!
Hang on a second.
Hello?

- I can't. I'll pick you up.  
Looking sharp.

            <div id = "right"> But this box contains aditional information. This box is also wider as it takes up 40% of the width of the screen.
                The reason this text is larger than the text on the right is because I couldn't come up with something funny so I just made it bigger
            so it looks like less text is the same size. </div>
